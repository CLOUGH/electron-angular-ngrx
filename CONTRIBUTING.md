# Contributing to Electron-Angular-NGRX
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github and Bitbucket (private)
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests for our opensource projects.
This seed was developed out of necessity for professional projects. This seed is maintained internally by my staff and myself and will remain paralell to our internal `master` branch.

## We Use [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request to `develop`. (I will not accept PRs to `master`)

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Kaffiend/electron-angular-ngrx/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Kaffiend/electron-angular-ngrx/issues); it's that easy!
